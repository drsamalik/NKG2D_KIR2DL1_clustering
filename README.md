# Spatial statistics of submicron size clusters of activating and inhibitory Natural Killer cell receptors in the resting state regulate early time signal discrimination

This project includes in-silico signaling modeling and information theory and image data for activating (NKG2D) and inhibtory (KIR2DL1).  

## ðŸ“‚ Data Folder (`data/`)  

The `data/` directory contains all the datasets used in this case study. It includes raw from references (doi:10.1126/scisignal.aal3606 and doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2016.04.075), processed after randomization. 

## ðŸ“‚ src Folder (`src/`)  

The `src/` directory contains spparks code to Monte-Carlo simulation. 

Remianing folder are to run the code for different stages of Kintic proof reading which futher can be analysed after generating data at later time.
